The Beacon SDK is a specialized software development kit for virtual tabletops.\nIt facilitates creating and managing interactive character sheets, roll templates, macros, and other VTT functionalities.\nThe SDK ensures easy communication between the VTT platform and the character sheets, allowing real-time updates and interactions.\nKey Features Character Sheets: Design and implement detailed character sheets with dynamic attributes and real-time updates. Roll Mechanics: Integrate complex roll formulas and display roll results directly within the VTT. Macros: Create and manage macros for automated actions and roll calculations. Event Handling: Utilize a comprehensive set of handlers to manage various events and interactions within the VTT. Legacy Support: Convert and integrate legacy macros and roll templates with the new Beacon architecture. Customization: Define custom actions computed properties and handle specific roll templates tailored to your game\u0026rsquo;s needs. Components Overview The Beacon SDK is composed of several key components:\nActions: Define and manage custom actions that can be triggered within the VTT. Handlers: Event handlers that process and respond to various VTT events and messages. Computed Properties: Define dynamically computed properties based on other attributes. Macro Attributes: Convert and manage legacy macro attributes for compatibility with the Beacon SDK. Rolls: Implement advanced roll mechanics and display results dynamically within the VTT. For a comprehensive overview of these components, view the components section.\nGetting Started To get started with the Beacon SDK, you must initialize the relay, set up your character sheets, and define the necessary actions, handlers, and computed properties.\nThis documentation provides detailed guides and examples to help you through each step of the process.\nBy leveraging the Beacon SDK, you can create rich, interactive, fully integrated VTT experiences that enhance gameplay and streamline game management.\nWhether adapting existing character sheets or building new ones from scratch, the Beacon SDK offers the tools and flexibility to bring your virtual tabletop to life.\n","date":"2024-05-07","id":3,"permalink":"/docs/guides/introduction/","summary":"The Beacon SDK is a toolset designed to enhance and streamline the development of virtual tabletop (VTT) character sheets and other interactive elements.","tags":[],"title":"Introduction"},{"content":"Prerequisites Before you can install the Beacon SDK, you\u0026rsquo;ll need to have Node.js installed on your machine.

They are defined in the sheet\u0026rsquo;s configuration and can interact with character data. Q2: How are computed properties used in the VTT?\rComputed properties are defined attributes accessible by the host, usable in macros, and assignable to token bars. They can represent derived values or complex calculations based on character data. Q3: What is the dispatch function used for?\rThe dispatch function provides methods for sending commands from the character sheet back to the host, including updating character data, performing actions, and interacting with the VTT interface. Q4: What are roll buttons, and how do they work?\rRoll buttons are HTML elements with specific attributes that execute designated sheet actions when clicked. They can pass arguments to the action method and are commonly used for triggering rolls from the character sheet. Q5: How are legacy macro attributes handled in the VTT?\rLegacy macro attributes can be mapped to the new sheet structure using the convertLegacyMacroAttributes function. Sheet developers can define how to handle legacy attribute values to ensure compatibility with existing macros. Q6: What is the purpose of the query function?\rThe query function displays a SweetAlert prompt to users and returns the results along with any errors. It is commonly used for interactive prompts or confirmations within the VTT interface. Q7: How are tokens managed in the VTT?\rTokens represent characters or objects on the virtual tabletop. Functions like getTokens, updateTokensByCharacter, and addToTracker are used to retrieve token information, update token data, and manage tokens in the turn tracker. Q8: What is the role of the convertLegacyMacroAttributesArgs type?\rThe convertLegacyMacroAttributesArgs type defines the arguments used for handling legacy macro attributes.

Add a sheet.json file:\nAdd a sheet.json file to your sheet folder to ensure the metadata for your sheet is up-to-date. For this, you can also find an example in our Quickstart Package JSON.\nCreate a Pull Request in the Community Sheet Repo:\nIn the Community Sheet Repo, create a pull request that must include the submission checklist from our previous process.\nSubmission Checklist When submitting a new or updated sheet to Roll20, it\u0026rsquo;s essential to follow the guidelines to ensure a smooth review and approval process.\nBelow is a checklist to help you prepare your submission.\nRequired The following are the required submission checklist items:\nThe pull request title clearly contains the name of the sheet I am editing. The pull request title clearly states the type of change I am submitting (New Sheet/New Feature/Bugfix/etc.). The pull request makes changes to files in only one sub-folder. The pull request does not contain changes to any JSON files in the translations folder (translation.json is permitted). New Sheet Details You must include the following information in your sheet:\nThe name of this game is: \u0026lt; THE AETHYRBLOOD CHRONICLES \u0026gt;. The publisher of this game is: \u0026lt; HAPHAZARD PROJECTS \u0026gt; The name of this game system/family is: \u0026lt; DPS System ('dice pool scales') \u0026gt; You must also check out the following:\nI have followed the Character Sheets Standards when building this sheet. I have authorization from the game\u0026rsquo;s publisher to make this an official sheet on Roll20 with their name attached. This game is not traditionally published, but a copy of the game rules can be purchased/downloaded/found at The Aethyrblood Chronicles Core Rule Book In the pull request comments, make sure to list the email addresses of the Roll20 users you\u0026rsquo;d like to have access to the sheet.\nWe can always grant more people access to the sheet after it is released. However, you can inform us in our Official Community Sheet Development Channels on Discord.\nApproval and Access:\nAfter you create a pull request, our team will approve it and add your sheet to the sheet selection in Roll20 Tabletop and Characters. We will then give only your Roll20 user and any others you\u0026rsquo;ve listed in the pull request comments access to the sheet in Roll20. This sheet will then be available for you and others with access to test it.\nReleasing a Final Version After you have released a test version of your sheet, you can follow the same steps as releasing a test version to make your sheet available to everyone. This time, the pull request comments state that it is a final release version.\nOnce you have created the pull request, our team will review the sheet functionality, code, and metadata for consistency, best practices, and overall system security. We reserve the right to reject any sheet that does not meet our terms of use or conflicts with our partnerships.\n","date":"2024-02-07","id":22,"permalink":"/docs/quick/release-sheet/","summary":"A release sheet is a finalized version of a character sheet or other content designed for use on the Roll20 platform.","tags":[],"title":"Release Sheet"},{"content":"Link to valuable, relevant resources.\n","date":"2024-02-27","id":23,"permalink":"/docs/resources/","summary":"Link to valuable, relevant resources.","tags":[],"title":"Resources"},{"content":"","date":"2023-09-07","id":24,"permalink":"/docs/","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Docs"},{"content":"","date":"2023-09-07","id":25,"permalink":"/privacy/","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Privacy Policy"},{"content":"","date":"2023-09-07","id":26,"permalink":"/","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Welcome to Beacon SDK"},{"content":"","date":"0001-01-01","id":27,"permalink":"/categories/","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Categories"},{"content":"","date":"0001-01-01","id":28,"permalink":"/contributors/","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Contributors"},{"content":"","date":"0001-01-01","id":29,"permalink":"/tags/","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Tags"}]
