These operations can range from simple tasks like rolling a dice to more complex interactions such as casting spells or activating abilities.</p></div><div class="info custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">Handlers</p><p>Handlers are event listeners that manage communication between the VTT and the character sheet. They respond to various events, such as changes in character attributes or settings, and trigger appropriate actions or updates.</p></div><div class="tip custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">Computed</p><p>Computed properties are dynamic values derived from other character attributes. They allow for the creation of complex, calculated attributes that automatically update when their dependencies change.</p></div><div class="warning custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">Macro Attributes</p><p>Macro attributes handle the conversion of legacy macro attributes to the new format used in the Beacon SDK. This ensures compatibility with older character sheets and macros, allowing for a smooth transition to the new system.</p></div><div class="important custom-block github-alert"><p class="custom-block-title">Rolls</p><p>The Rolls component allows for advanced dice-rolling mechanics within the VTT.
