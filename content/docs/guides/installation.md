This installation guide is designed for sheet developers that want to start creating a sheet from scratch or already have an existing project they wish to start from. To get started quickly with a boilerplate, you can download and start editing the [Quick Start Example Sheet](https://github.com/Roll20/roll20-beacon-sheets/tree/main/sheets/quickstart-example-sheet) which already has the Beacon SDK installed in a [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/guide/introduction.html) project. 

## Prerequisites

Before you can install the Beacon SDK, you'll need to have the following completed. 
- A local development environment with a code editor.
- Node.js installed on your machine. If you don't have Node.js installed, use the following steps in the [official Node.js documentation](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager).
- A project with a javascript framework. We suggest [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/guide/introduction.html) but you can choose whichever you are more comfortable with.

These steps use the npm package manager but you are free to use any package manager you prefer.

The following steps will guide you in installing the Beacon SDK in your application:


## Step 1: Add the package to your `package.json`.

  Under the `dependencies` object key of your `package.json`, add a new string key called `@roll20/beacon-sdk` with the version you want to install from our version history.

  **For example**:

    ```json
    {
      "@roll20/beacon-sdk": "0.0.0"
    }
    ```

    For more information about installing packages, refer to the [NPM documentation](https://docs.npmjs.com/specifying-dependencies-and-devdependencies-in-a-package-json-file).

## Step 2: Run `npm install`.

    Open a terminal in the root of your applicationâ€™s folder and run the following command:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

    For more information about NPM commands, refer to the [NPM install documentation](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v6/commands/npm-install).

## Import the necessary package contents in your application.

    The package exports various utilities you can use in your application. For example, you will need to utilize the `initRelay` function from the package.

    Here's an import statement for that function:

    ```javascript
    import { initRelay } from '@roll20/beacon-sdk';
    ```

    <!-- We need to add a link to learn more about the InitRelay -->

    For more information about imports, refer to the [JavaScript import documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/import).
